Create bubbles with text and watch them float and bounce against each other, and flick them around. Customize the bubbles color, text size, movement parameters, etc. I made this on a whim after one day trying to visualize everything on my mind, and scribbling a bunch of circles with words in them sprawled out on a paper. The prototype didn't turn out to be as fun as I thought it might be, and I don't think it's as useful as I thought it might be either. Oh well.
